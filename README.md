# Fish O' Pedia

A web application for fish watchers who want to learn about fish.

I am a certified scuba diver since 2016 and love meeting the undersea world. I have bumped into  butterfly fish, puffer fish, squirralfish and parrotfish inside and beyond the coral reefs. But sometimes I do not recoganize the sea animal I am looking at. This triggers my curiosity! That is why I created Fish Oâ€™ Pedia so everyone can learn about fish!
